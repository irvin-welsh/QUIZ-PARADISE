# QUIZ-PARADISE
Console app to pass quizes. Mostly, for school students. 
Adding new quizes and improvements constantly

Project's backlog:
1. - GEO quiz first time released
2. - added functionality to store results in a form of "txt" file
3. - added Main Menu functionality and Help page
4. - added sqlite3 to the project. Now, results are stored in DB (locally)
5. - improved Main Menu functionality using case..switch logic (actually, done with dictionaries because no case..switch in python)
6. - added parser to get all country:capital pairs and insert it to the table in DB. Parser must be used only once and then data retreived locally form DB.

#############################################################################################

Further plans:
1) Add unique identifier for each user passing quiz to update results in DB
2) Add Math quiz (with random question generated by separate func())
3) Place script to the web and provide anyone with ability to pass it online and see players rating in real-time (gamification)
4) Create simple API for 3rd parties integration

Let's see what it takes to finish all the plans :)
